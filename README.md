# HTML-Jinja

Ad-hoc apporach to highlighting HTML-Jinja templates. Uses HTML as the core language and injections for Jinja highlighting.

See [this extension](https://github.com/ArcherHume/jinja2-support) for a more appropriate approach. It uses Jinja as the core language and injections for HTML highlighting, which is the correct and scalable way to approach this. However in its current form it does not highlight fairly simple templates correctly, as HTML and Jinja codeblocks become mixed and highlighted incorrectly. Highlighting a templating language is tricky work!

The extension you're looking at now ALSO highlights things incorrectly, but in a different/subtler way.
